## Supported Operating Systems

Intel(R) Metrics Discovery Application Programming Interface is supported on Linux family operating systems with minimum kernel version 4.14.
Event based measurements require minimum Mesa version 18.2.

### Detailed minimum version requirements

| Platform | Code Name | Minimum Linux Kernel Version | Minimum Mesa Version |
|--|--|--|--|
| Arc | Alchemist | 5.20 | 22.1.5 |
| Gen12 | Rocket Lake | 5.17 | 22.1.5 |
| Gen12 | DG1 | 5.13 | 22.1.5 |
| Gen12 | Tiger Lake | 5.9 | 21.0 |

## Build and Install

1\. Download sources.

2\. Install libdrm-dev.

```shell
sudo apt install libdrm-dev
or
sudo dnf install libdrm-devel
```

3\. Run CMake generation:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

4\. Build:

```shell
make -j$(nproc)
```

5\. Built library will be here (for 64-bit Linux):

```shell
(project_root)/dump/linux64/release/metrics_discovery/libigdmd.so
```

6\. Install:

If using native package manager (yum, dnf, etc..) skip to step 7
```shell
sudo make install
```

7\. Packaging:

```shell
make package
```
After the process completes, there should be a set of files such as
``` code
intel-metrics-discovery-[VERSION].x86_64.rpm
intel-metrics-discovery-devel-[VERSION].x86_64.rpm
intel-metrics-discovery-pkgconfig-[VERSION].x86_64.rpm
```



*Note: To clear CMake params remove CMakeCache.txt, then regenerate.*
